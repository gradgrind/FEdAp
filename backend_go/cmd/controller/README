To compile, run in this directory:
go build -o ../../../bin/backend

It would be good to support a number of input formats. Currently
envisaged are:

*) The "native" format, at present a basic JSON dump of the database.

*) W365 XML (full data)

*) W365 "_w365.json" (W365 output for timetabling, limited scope)

*) FET ".fet" (very limited scope â€“ it may be difficult to map this
to courses)
Manual editing of a FET-generated timetable should definitely be an
aim, though I might need to place limits on some structural elements
(Class/group/subgroup structure).

*) FET result file (which one?), so that FET can be used as a back-end
for timetable generation. Using the "...data_and_timetable.fet" output
would possibly be the most convenient as it could be combined with
the previous point.

Outputs:

*) Save in "native" (JSON) format.

*) FET ".fet", perhaps with and without unfixed placements?

*) Perhaps W365, but this is more difficult.
